<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Personal-contact-page](./assets/storage/Screenshot%202021-11-17%20at%2014-50-43%20Document.png)](https://personal-contact-page.thibaut-fourneaux.be/)

Exercise realized during the WebDev Junior training given by BeCode, concerning PHP.

### Instructions:

#### Part 0: plan the work ahead

- Study all the project aspects, from frontend to backend, then make a mock-up (mobile first but the other views as well), as I mentioned, this component can be reused later, do things seriously, it will save you a lot of time.
Think about the project strategy, accessibility, readability, ease of use, user experience...
Also set up your graphic chart, fonts, icons, colors, images, logo, buttons...
You can be inspired by the current ergonomic standards but you can also be creative, as long as it is compatible with the previous mentions.

#### Part 1: HTML

- Start by creating the HTML of the page, do not forget the progressive improvement and accessibility to all users.

#### Part 2: CSS

- Use *bootstrap*, *bulma*, *tailwind*, *materialize*, ... to quickly get your visual or not, just respect the graphic chart and the layout.

#### Part 3: PHP

- Setting up the form
- To help you during development, display the *rough data* received from the form
with the help of the [print_r](http://php.net/manual/en/function.print-r.php) PHP function.

#### Part 4: Process the form data

- Sanitize the input from things like `<script>`, then validate the
content (obligatory field, valid email, etc...), ending by an email sent and a
feedback for the user.

#### Part 5: Prepare the repository

- The repository must be presented in a professional way, with a coherent readme that perfectly summarizes your project

#### Requirements

Must have:

- Header/Form/Footer
- the project repository must include a low-fidelity mock-up
- the form's html code *must* be semantically valid
- the HTML *must be* accessible to blind people
- in case of wrong input, the form should display a useful visual clue about the error
- display the error message near the correct input field
- the error message must be readable (helpful to users)
- the form has to be *sanitised* and *validated* (server side)
- if all required inputs are valid, the script should respond by email to a given address
- implement a [honeypot](https://www.thryv.com/blog/honeypot-technique/) anti spam technique.

Optional:

- client side validation with *JavaScript*
- work on a good and clear _user experience_ (UX)
- respond to the user request with AJAX
- logo
- start the other pages of your portfolio (presentation, projects ...)
